# Project TODOs

### Devise
1. Style admin login page
    https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/login-page-20

### Games model
1. Add "last played" timestamp ==> maybe this is unique to collections?
                               ==> could be a join table or something

### Homepage
1. Add "last played" column
2. Make columns sortable

### Modal
1. Show players who own the game (i.e. not in a wishlist)
2. Show "last played" timestamp
3. Add button/input to update "last played" timestamp
